# Expense Tracker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load fonts.

## Tests & CI

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for CI and coverage.

Key scripts (already in `package.json`):

- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` — run TypeScript type checks
- `npm run test` — run unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run test:coverage` — run tests and produce coverage (lcov + html)

Run tests locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run test
```

Coverage report will be written to `coverage/` when running `npm run test:coverage`.

Badges above show CI status and coverage (Codecov). If you want Codecov uploads to work for private repos, add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to repository secrets.
